## Translating Vanilla

Want to help us improve our translations? We have a [Transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/vanilla/) for contributing to this. Create an account there and submit your improvements.

Need to customize the phrasing just on your site in particular? See "Overriding locales" below.

## Translation tips

Want to help translate? Awesome! Here are some tips for creating great translations.

1. Please make sure that your changes use generic terminology and good grammar that can apply to all forums and avoids interest- or region-specific terms.
2. Avoid HTML encoding of UTF-8 characters. For example, just use `รถ`, not `&ouml;`. Vanilla's entire stack is UTF-8 so the former _always_ works, but our default emails are not HTML, so the latter will fail.

## Installing locales

1. Download the locale you want from the [Addon Directory](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/browse/locales/popular/2).
2. Upload the folder to your `locales` folder.
3. In the Dashboard, go to `Addons > Locales`.
4. Enable the locale.
5. Change the Default Locale at the top of the page, and Save.

## Using multiple locales

The [Multilingual plugin](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/multilingual-plugin) allows each user select their preference from all enabled locales.

## Overriding locales

```php
<?php if (!defined('APPLICATION')) exit();

// Note about what you're translating
$Definition['TranslationString1'] = "Override String 1";
$Definition['TranslationString2'] = "Override String 2";

// More stuff
$Definition['TranslationString3'] = "Override String 3";
$Definition['TranslationString4'] = "Override String 4";
```

You can override your default locale by adding a `conf/locale.php` file to your installation with additional definitions. Any definitions in this file will override your locale.

If you duplicate an entry's translation string, the latter one will take precedence. You can, however, assign the same override string to multiple translation strings.

If you are using Multilingual to enable multiple locales, please note his override will effect **all** locales. There is currently no way to override multiple locales selectively.
