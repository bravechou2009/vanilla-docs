## Using Categories

Categories are how Vanilla organizes discussions. Categories can be added, edited, deleted, sorted, and tiered via the Dashboard. Every discussion is placed in one (and only one) category. 

You can find Categories under the “Forum" menu in the Dashboard,

At the top of the page, you will presented with the option to either add a new category, or disable them completely:

!["Add Category" and "Don't use Categories" buttons in the Manage Categories section of the dashboard](http://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.r23.cf1.rackcdn.com/laurasothertest.vanillaforums.com/editor/2o/34let6oiypkp.png)

Disabling categories will streamline your organization, reducing the forum to the "Recent Discussion" view. You can toggle categories off on at any point, threads that were previously in categories will no longer display an indication of this. If you decide to use categories once more, any threads that were already designated to a particular section will be restored. Threads made while categories weren't in use will be placed into whatever category is at the top of your list. 


## Adding Categories

Clicking the "Add Category" button will take you to the page pictured below:

By default, the category url will reflect the category’s name. Clicking the edit button next to the url will allow you to change the slug. Below it, you can add a description for the category, which may not be visible on your homepage, depending on your theme. 

You can add a unique CSS class, which you can use in your theme to control its appearance. The specified text will be added as a class for the category's HTML wrapper.

The "Display As" drop down changes the behaivor of a category. Changing a category to a Header, 



## Category Page Layout

"Place nested categories in a comma-delimited list" is a way of making sub-categories more compact on the Categories page. We recommend keeping the default (2 levels deep) in most cases.

The option "Display root categories as headings" should only be used if you have organized your categories into 2 or more tiers (so that some categories are indented under others). It turns the top-level categories into text "headers" that cannot be posted in directly. Therefore, if you have only 1 tier of forums (a list with no indents) it will lockdown all your categories and make it impossible to start a new discussion.

"Do not display the categories in the side panel" hides the default category list that shows up in the panel as a shortcut. Select this option if you have many categories (more than a dozen) that would make the list unwieldy.

## Organizing Categories

Drag and drop your categories to organize them! Slide them to the right slightly to tier them under the category directly above them.

## Choosing a Categories view

On the "Homepage" settings page in your Dashboard under "Category Layout" there are options for how to display the Categories page for your users. The "Mixed Layout" option shows up to five discussions with the most recent comment under each category.

## Edit a Category

To edit a category, click the "Edit" button beside it in the Categories list in the Dashboard. When editing a category, you can Archive it. This hides the category and hides all of its discussions from the Recent Discussions list. It still obeys its normal permissions for posting.

## Move All Discussions

To move all discussions from one category to another, delete the category.

## Deleting a Category

To delete a category, click the "Delete" button beside it in the Categories list in the Dashboard. You will be prompted to select a replacement category.

When you delete a category all discussions contained within that category will be deleted as well. If you wish to retain these posts you must choose a replacement category. The Replacement Category dropdown menu will allow you to choose which Category to move the orphaned discussions into. All categories in your forum will appear in this menu.
