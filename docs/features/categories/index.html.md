# Using Categories

Categories are how Vanilla organizes discussions. Categories can be added, edited, deleted, sorted, and tiered via the Dashboard. Every discussion is placed in one (and only one) category. Every forum has a "Categories" page that lists its categories for navigation.

## Adding Categories

To add a category, click the "Add Category" button at the top of the "Categories" page in the Dashboard. As you type a name, Vanilla will auto-generate the Category Url which you can customize by clicking the "edit" link next to it.

The "Css Class" is a tool for themers to style visually-distinct categories (the specified text will be added as a class to the category's HTML wrapper). The "Photo" is a 100x100 image that will appear next to the category on the Categories page.

The "Display As" option can be set to "Categories" in order to turn a category into a "container" for other categories without allowing discussions to be placed in it directly.

"Hide from the Recent Discussions page" does just what it says on the tin.

"Track points for this category separately" is an advanced feature that is deprecated in core and will be removed in a future version.

"This category has custom permissions" specifies whether this category has its own permissions set or will instead inherit the default category permissions for each role.

If you have the File Uploads addon enabled, you will have a "Allow File Uploads" option.

## Category Page Layout

"Place nested categories in a comma-delimited list" is a way of making sub-categories more compact on the Categories page. We recommend keeping the default (2 levels deep) in most cases.

The option "Display root categories as headings" should only be used if you have organized your categories into 2 or more tiers (so that some categories are indented under others). It turns the top-level categories into text "headers" that cannot be posted in directly. Therefore, if you have only 1 tier of forums (a list with no indents) it will lockdown all your categories and make it impossible to start a new discussion.

"Do not display the categories in the side panel" hides the default category list that shows up in the panel as a shortcut. Select this option if you have many categories (more than a dozen) that would make the list unwieldy.

## Organizing Categories

Drag and drop your categories to organize them! Slide them to the right slightly to tier them under the category directly above them.

## Choosing a Categories view

On the "Homepage" settings page in your Dashboard under "Category Layout" there are options for how to display the Categories page for your users. The "Mixed Layout" option shows up to five discussions with the most recent comment under each category.

## Edit a Category

To edit a category, click the "Edit" button beside it in the Categories list in the Dashboard. When editing a category, you can Archive it. This hides the category and hides all of its discussions from the Recent Discussions list. It still obeys its normal permissions for posting.

## Move All Discussions

To move all discussions from one category to another, delete the category.

## Deleting a Category

To delete a category, click the "Delete" button beside it in the Categories list in the Dashboard. You will be prompted to select a replacement category.

When you delete a category all discussions contained within that category will be deleted as well. If you wish to retain these posts you must choose a replacement category. The Replacement Category dropdown menu will allow you to choose which Category to move the orphaned discussions into. All categories in your forum will appear in this menu.
