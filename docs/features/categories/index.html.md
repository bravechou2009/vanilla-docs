# Using Categories

Categories are how Vanilla organizes discussions. Categories can be added, edited, deleted, sorted, and tiered via the Dashboard. Every discussion is placed in one (and only one) category.

You can find Categories under the “Forum" menu in the Dashboard,

At the top of the page, you will presented with the option to either add a new category, or disable them completely:

Disabling categories will streamline your organization, reducing the forum to the "Recent Discussion" view. You can toggle categories off on at any point. If you decide to use categories once more, any threads that were already designated to a particular section will be restored. Threads made while categories weren't in use will be placed into whatever category is at the top of your list.


## Adding Categories

Clicking the "Add Category" button will take you to the page pictured below:

By default, the category url will reflect the category’s name. Clicking the edit button next to the url will allow you to change the slug. Below it, you can add a description for the category, which will display on your homepage if your current theme allows it.

You can add a unique CSS class, which you can use in your theme to control its appearance. The specified text will be added as a class for the category's HTML wrapper.

The "Display As" drop down changes the behavior of a category:

**Header:** Uses the category as a plain text header. The category will be not be selectable in the editor, forcing users to post in its sub-categories. 
**Categories:** Uses the category as a container to display its sub-categories upon clicking through.
**Discussions:** The standard view that displays threads 


## Category Page Layout

"Place nested categories in a comma-delimited list" is a way of making sub-categories more compact on the Categories page.

We recommend keeping the default (2 levels deep) in most cases.

"Do not display the categories in the side panel" hides the default category list that shows up in the panel as a shortcut. Select this option if you have many categories (more than a dozen) that would make the list unwieldy.

## Organizing Categories

Drag and drop your categories to organize them. Slide them to the right slightly to nest them under the category directly above them.

The option "Display root categories as headings" turns the top-level categories into plain text "headers". Headers are sections that cannot be posted in directly, so be sure to nest a category underneath your root if you select this option. 

## Choosing a Categories view

In the "Homepage" settings page in your Dashboard under "Category Layout" there are options for how to display the Categories page for your users. The "Mixed Layout" option shows up to five discussions with the most recent comment under each category.

## Deleting a Category

To delete a category, click the "Delete" button beside it in the Dashboard. You will be prompted to select a replacement category from a drop down menu. If you elect not to choose a replacement category, all threads and posts will be deleted. 

## Unfollow a Category

On the main categories page, each section has a cogwheel menu with the option to "Hide" the category from view. By default, you will only see your "Followed Categories" when viewing forum index, but if you'd like to see hidden categories, simple toggle your view to "All Categories" with the option at the bottom of the sidebar.

 When you are viewing all categories, you can unhide sections with the same cogwheel menu.
